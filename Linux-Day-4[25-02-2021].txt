1) - You need to set the umask value to 022 & it should be permanent
-> Try to see the files & folder created after checking the umask
2) -> Again change the umask value to the default value
3) -> You need create files by root & see that other user & group can't access
them
-> Files created by other user can be accessed by the group owners
4)
Create a directory on the desktop with the name as CapgeminiFolder
- make sure the members of the group i.e "BigDataEmplyee" should be able to
access the data inside the drectory
- and other users can't access it
- Make sure one thing one user can't access or write the file of other user
present in the above shared directory
- But make sure, the user {manager} he should be able to access all the data
& can remove the files
